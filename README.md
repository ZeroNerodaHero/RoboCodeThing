# RoboCodeThing
## PUT THE STRATEGY HERE:

* Randomize a number of moves, the HAVEATITBOT won't be able to tell what it is doing
* When see fire, change directions.

## In the see events function:
* Get all the things
* If it has a big amount of hp, start rushing at it
  * The trig shit
* Else just keep distance
  * Just be sniper


## NOTES FOR OTHER PPL
-Cats are bad
